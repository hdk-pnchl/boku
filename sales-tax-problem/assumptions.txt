	Input structure exactly follow the sample input i.e.
		each new line is one product
		if we comma separate the line with " ", the 1st token would be quantity and last token would be price
		everything in between 1st and last token is product description.
		i.e. there are atleast 3 token is it, quantity, productDesc, price
		*"Input 1:", will appear at the beginning of new receipt(collection of product).
2.
	Product description contains detail about the product feature
		if imported
		what type of product it is?  example: food, medical, books etc
		In product description, there should not be more then 1 type feature.
			i.e. description should not contain feature as 'FOOD' along with 'BOOK'
